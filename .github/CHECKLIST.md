- [x] Dependencies (same node_modules)
- [x] Agent functionality (identical behavior)
- [x] Smoke test logic (preserved exactly)

## Testing Recommendations

### Before First Release

1. **Dry Run Test:**
   ```bash
   # Test the workflow locally (won't create release)
   git checkout -b test-release
   git tag v0.0.1-test
   # Push to feature branch (not main)
   git push origin test-release
   git push origin v0.0.1-test
   # Watch Actions tab, then delete tag
   ```

2. **Manual Workflow Test:**
   - Go to Actions → "Release Agent with Provenance"
   - Click "Run workflow"
   - Enter version: `v0.0.1-test`
   - Verify it builds and creates draft release
   - Delete the draft release

3. **Verification Test:**
   ```bash
   # After a test release is created
   gh attestation verify idt-agent-windows-v0.0.1-test.zip -R MMZaini/idt-react
   ```

### For Production Release

1. **Ensure Clean State:**
   ```bash
   git status  # Should be clean
   git pull origin main  # Up to date
   ```

2. **Create Release:**
   ```bash
   git tag v1.0.0
   git push origin v1.0.0
   ```

3. **Monitor:**
   - Watch Actions tab for workflow progress
   - Check for any build failures
   - Verify smoke tests pass

4. **Verify Release:**
   - Check Releases page for new release
   - Download both ZIPs
   - Verify attestations:
     ```bash
     gh attestation verify idt-agent-windows-v1.0.0.zip -R MMZaini/idt-react
     gh attestation verify idt-agent-macos-v1.0.0.zip -R MMZaini/idt-react
     ```

5. **Test Downloads:**
   - Extract ZIPs
   - Run agents
   - Verify health endpoints
   - Test with web UI

## Success Criteria

### ✅ Release Workflow Passes
- Both builds complete successfully
- Smoke tests pass
- Attestations generated
- ZIPs uploaded to release

### ✅ Verification Works
- `gh attestation verify` succeeds
- Shows correct repo and workflow
- No verification errors

### ✅ Artifacts Are Correct
- ZIPs contain all required files
- README includes provenance info
- Agents run successfully when extracted

### ✅ Documentation Complete
- All guides are clear and accurate
- Verification steps work as documented
- Links point to correct locations

## Known Limitations

1. **Manual Version Updates:** 
   - UI download links need manual update after releases
   - Consider using "latest" download URLs or env vars

2. **macOS Download Link:**
   - Currently disabled in UI (no URL set)
   - Update `src/app/order/page.tsx` after first macOS release

3. **First Release Setup:**
   - Need to create first tag manually
   - GitHub repository settings must allow attestations

## Troubleshooting

### If Attestation Fails

Check:
- Repository settings → Actions → General → "Allow GitHub Actions to create attestations"
- Workflow has `id-token: write` and `attestations: write` permissions
- Using `actions/attest-build-provenance@v1` (latest version)

### If Release Doesn't Create

Check:
- Tag matches pattern `v*.*.*` (e.g., `v1.0.0`)
- Workflow has `contents: write` permission
- No existing release with same tag

### If Smoke Test Fails

Check:
- All required files are in dist/ folder
- ChromeDriver is compatible with installed Chrome
- Port 4799 is not in use
- Logs in Actions for specific error messages

## Post-Implementation Tasks

- [ ] Create first test release (v0.0.1-test)
- [ ] Verify attestations work
- [ ] Delete test release
- [ ] Create production release (v1.0.0)
- [ ] Update UI download links
- [ ] Announce release with verification instructions
- [ ] Update project status/badges if desired

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

- Add release badges to README
- Create CHANGELOG.md automation
- Add Windows code signing certificate
- Add macOS notarization
- Create release announcement template
- Add download statistics tracking
