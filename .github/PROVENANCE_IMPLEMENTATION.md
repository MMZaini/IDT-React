## 🔒 Security Features

### Build Provenance (SLSA)

Every official release now includes:

1. **Cryptographic Attestations**
   - Signed by GitHub's build infrastructure
   - Links artifact to source code commit
   - Proves the build wasn't tampered with

2. **Verification Command**
   ```bash
   gh attestation verify <file> -R MMZaini/idt-react
   ```

3. **Transparent Build Process**
   - All builds run in public GitHub Actions
   - Full logs available for audit
   - Reproducible builds with `npm ci`

### What Changed vs Original

**Before:**
- Manual artifact uploads (no provenance)
- No release automation
- No verification possible
- Trust based on repository alone

**After:**
- Automated releases with provenance
- Cryptographic proof of authenticity
- User-verifiable downloads
- Supply chain attack protection

## 📋 How It Works

### Release Workflow Trigger Options

#### Option 1: Git Tag (Recommended)
```bash
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```
→ Automatically builds, attests, and releases

#### Option 2: Manual Workflow Dispatch
1. Go to Actions tab
2. Select "Release Agent with Provenance"
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Enter version number
5. Click "Run workflow"

### What Happens During Release

```
1. Checkout code
2. Install dependencies (npm ci)
3. Build Windows agent
   ├─ Create idt-agent.exe
   ├─ Copy chromedriver.exe
   ├─ Copy node_modules
   └─ Generate README.txt
4. Create ZIP archive (versioned filename)
5. Generate provenance attestation ← NEW!
6. Run portability smoke test
7. Upload artifact
8. [Repeat 3-7 for macOS]
9. Create GitHub Release
   ├─ Upload Windows ZIP
   ├─ Upload macOS ZIP
   ├─ Attach provenance attestations ← NEW!
   └─ Add release notes with verification instructions
```

## 🎯 Key Improvements

### For Users

✅ **Trust:** Can verify downloads are authentic  
✅ **Security:** Protected against supply chain attacks  
✅ **Transparency:** Can see exactly how builds were created  
✅ **Documentation:** Clear guides for verification  

### For Maintainers

✅ **Automation:** One command to release  
✅ **Reproducibility:** `npm ci` ensures consistent builds  
✅ **Testing:** Smoke tests on every build  
✅ **Documentation:** Clear process for creating releases  

### For the Project

✅ **Professional:** Industry-standard security practices  
✅ **Efficient:** Automated release process  
✅ **Auditable:** Full build transparency  
✅ **Maintainable:** Well-documented workflows

## 🔄 Workflow Comparison

### CI Workflow (build-agent.yml)

**Purpose:** Testing and validation  
**Trigger:** Push to main, PRs  
**Outputs:** Temporary artifacts (90 days)  
**Provenance:** No  
**Use:** Development and testing  

### Release Workflow (release-agent.yml)

**Purpose:** Production releases  
**Trigger:** Git tags, manual  
**Outputs:** Permanent releases  
**Provenance:** Yes ✅  
**Use:** End-user downloads

## 📦 Release Artifact Structure

Each release creates versioned ZIPs:

```
idt-agent-windows-v1.0.0.zip
├── idt-agent.exe
├── chromedriver.exe
├── runner-core-selenium.js
├── README.txt (includes verification instructions)
└── node_modules/
    ├── selenium-webdriver/
    ├── tmp/
    ├── jszip/
    ├── ws/
    ├── setimmediate/
    └── @bazel/runfiles/

idt-agent-macos-v1.0.0.zip
├── idt-agent
├── chromedriver
├── runner-core-selenium.js
├── README.txt
└── node_modules/
    └── (same as Windows)
```

---

## ✨ What Stayed the Same

✅ **Build process:** Identical pkg compilation  
✅ **Dependencies:** Same node_modules included  
✅ **Functionality:** Agent works exactly the same  
✅ **Smoke tests:** Same portability validation  
✅ **File structure:** Same dist/ layout  

**The application behavior is 100% unchanged.**  
Only the release process and verification were enhanced.

## 🚀 Next Steps

### To Create Your First Release

1. Ensure all changes are committed
2. Create and push a tag:
   ```bash
   git tag v1.0.0
   git push origin v1.0.0
   ```
3. Watch the Actions tab for the build
4. Check Releases page for the published release
5. Download and verify:
   ```bash
   gh attestation verify idt-agent-windows-v1.0.0.zip -R MMZaini/idt-react
   ```

### To Update Download Links in UI

Update `src/app/order/page.tsx` around line 66-67:

```typescript
const downloadWin = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_AGENT_WIN_URL || 
  'https://github.com/MMZaini/idt-react/releases/latest/download/idt-agent-windows-v1.0.0.zip';

const downloadMac = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_AGENT_MAC_URL || 
  'https://github.com/MMZaini/idt-react/releases/latest/download/idt-agent-macos-v1.0.0.zip';
```

Or use environment variables in Vercel to point to latest.
