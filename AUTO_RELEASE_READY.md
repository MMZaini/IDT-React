# ✅ Auto-Release System Ready!

## 🎉 What's New

Your agent now **automatically releases** on every push to main! No manual steps needed.

---

## 🚀 How It Works Now

### Simple: Just Push Your Code

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "fix: improve ChromeDriver detection"
git push origin main
```

**Result:**
- ✅ Automatic build (3-5 minutes)
- ✅ Pre-release created: `v0.1.0-a3b5c7d`
- ✅ Provenance attestations included
- ✅ Concise, agent-focused release notes
- ✅ Ready for users to test

### When Ready for Stable

```bash
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

**Result:**
- ✅ Stable release: `v1.0.0`
- ✅ Marked as "Latest" on GitHub
- ✅ Recommended for end users

---

## 📋 Release Notes Format

All releases now use a **concise, agent-focused** format:

```markdown
## IDT Local Agent

Desktop automation agent for bulk DNA oligonucleotide ordering from IDT.
Runs on your computer to automate browser interaction with the IDT website.

### 📦 Download & Install

1. Download the ZIP for your OS
2. Extract to any folder
3. Run the agent
4. Use the web UI to submit orders

### 🔒 Verify Download (Recommended)

gh attestation verify idt-agent-windows-v1.0.0.zip -R MMZaini/idt-react

### ⚙️ How It Works

- Listens for order submissions from web UI
- Launches Chrome with Selenium automation
- Fills IDT bulk order form
- Adds items to cart for review

### 📋 Requirements

- Chrome browser installed
- Windows 10+ or macOS 10.15+
```

**Clean, focused, no fluff.** ✨

---

## 🎯 Triggers

Automatic releases happen when you push changes to:

- ✅ `scripts/local-agent.js`
- ✅ `scripts/runner-core-selenium.js`
- ✅ `scripts/copy-chromedriver.js`
- ✅ `scripts/copy-runtime-deps.js`
- ✅ `scripts/generate-dist-readme.js`
- ✅ `package.json`
- ✅ `package-lock.json`

**Other file changes?** No release triggered (CI still runs for testing)

---

## 📊 Release Types

### Auto-Releases (Pre-release)

**Trigger:** Push to main  
**Version:** `v0.1.0-a3b5c7d` (package.json + commit SHA)

## 📝 Example Workflow

**Monday: Fix a bug**
```bash
git commit -m "fix: ChromeDriver version detection"
git push
```
→ Auto-release: `v0.1.0-f5a3b2c` (pre-release)

**Tuesday: Add feature**
```bash
git commit -m "feat: support custom port"
git push
```
→ Auto-release: `v0.1.0-d7e9a4f` (pre-release)

**Wednesday: Ready for users**
```bash
npm version minor  # v0.1.0 → v0.2.0
git push
git tag v0.2.0
git push origin v0.2.0
```
→ Stable release: `v0.2.0` (recommended)

---

## 🎬 Next Step: Push to GitHub

```bash
git push origin main
```

**This will:**
1. Push your changes
2. Trigger the first auto-release
3. Create `v0.1.0-{commit-sha}` (pre-release)
4. Prove everything works end-to-end

**Watch it happen:**
- Actions tab: See the build
- Releases page: See your first auto-release
