IDT React â€” Automated, Improved DNA Oligonucleotide and Probes Ordering

A modern web application for bulk ordering DNA oligonucleotides and probes from Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT), with browser automation via a local agent.

### ðŸš€ Quick Start

**For Users:**
1. Download the latest agent for your OS from [Releases](https://github.com/MMZaini/idt-react/releases)
2. Verify your download (recommended): See [Verification Guide](.github/VERIFY_DOWNLOAD.md)
3. Extract and run the agent
4. Visit the web UI @ https://idt-react.vercel.app/ and start ordering!

**For Developers:**

First, install dependencies and run the development server:

```bash
npm ci
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
- **Automation** (`scripts/runner-core-selenium.js`) - Selenium-based IDT website automation
gh attestation verify idt-agent-windows-v1.0.0.zip -R MMZaini/idt-react
```

Where to look next
- `src/app/` â€” Next.js app and UI
- `scripts/` â€” Local agent + packaging scripts (pkg, chromedriver copy, etc.)
- `.github/workflows/` â€” CI and release workflows
- `.github/VERIFY_DOWNLOAD.md` â€” Short user guide for verification (kept as reference)

If you need the long step-by-step release process or implementation notes they were consolidated into this README â€” the original `.github/*.md` files are removed to avoid duplication.

# Run agent locally for testing
npm run agent
```
